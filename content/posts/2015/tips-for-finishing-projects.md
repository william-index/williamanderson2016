## Secrets of Side-projects

Making time and working on side projects outside of work can be REALLY tough, but making and sharing things feels awesome. As multiple colleagues and many people people outside of work ask how I manage to complete so many projects, I wanted to share my strategies.

They may not work for everyone, but if you like so many others have 200 projects started and zero finished, I think these tips will help.

> You should embrace inspiration that comes to you regardless of the form the output would take.

## Keeping a Backlog
Inspiration can come at any time, and some project ideas will be more feasible that others, these ideas don't always have to be the same genre, and you should embrace inspiration that comes to you regardless of the form the output would take, just always write it down.

You want to ultimately amass a long list of possible project ideas, some will be bad and that is totally okay! But there are some key things you need for this list.

* It must be with you at all times
* You need amble space to elaborate and write thoughts on each entry
* You need to be able to categorize ideas into at least these lists:
    * Project Ideas
    * Active Projects
    * Discarded Ideas

I highly recommend using a digital application to manage this, as your phone is most probably with you at all times. I use the default **Notes** application for iOS, but any list/note tool will most likely work.

### Refining Ideas
When you think of something for the first time, it will most likely be a less refined idea, and thats when you need to capture it. Projects that you are more interested in or passionate about will stick with you longer and you will want to elaborate on your thoughts, let things sit in your backlog of projects for at least a few days before you start one, and write down any new ideas.

As a rule, NEVER delete thoughts from the project idea, just keep adding, you want this to be a brain dump of possibilities. As a sample, this is what the entry for my [https://www.patreon.com/posts/sea-bees-6680627](Sea Bees) project looked like before I started:

## Story Sized Projects
Now that you have a bunch of ideas written down, and hopefully a few with lots of thoughts in them that you are passionate about, its time to pick one to work on.

If you aren't used to finishing projects regularly, we want to pick something you can finish within about 2â€”4 hours. Think of this more as a feature or subtask even, you want what you build to be a clearly defined completable task. The only critical difference is this feature sized task is going to be your final shippable product. This will usually mean you need to significantly reduce the features you wanted or the scale.

> Very simple/small projects are actually ideal, the most important part of working on side projects at this phase is to build a rhythm of completion for yourself.

Think of it like this, if you want to make a clone of Farmville, you may need to scale down to a game where the goal is just to water a single plant daily and keep it alive.

## Finishing Work
The most critical thing here is to finish what you start, no matter what. If you start a project, finish it, ideally in the same day!

From the plant raising example above, there is still a lot you need to do and consider. What do you build the project in? Where is it hosted? What will it look like visually? Who is the target audience? How do they learn how to use it? And MUCH more. Chances are that simplified game idea, still may be too complex. Ad you think it through and start building, just keep slashing features until its something you can finish in an afternoon.

### Quality
As you are moving fast, you will make mistakes, its human. You may not even like the project you create. I've made some myself that to be honest turned out completely awful! See below, you will know what I mean if you hit the play button in the bottom right:

But all the same, its CRITICAL to upload it and share it. Let people see it, embrace failure, but feel good that you finished what you started.

### Feedback
> Never refactor, revise, or edit.

You will definitely get feedback/comments/etc from co-workers, internet randos, partners/spouses, whoever. Its going to be REALLY tempting go back and make adjustments to fine tune and make something perfect.

Listen to all the feedback you get, internalize it and reflect, but don't refactor/revise/edit. Use that knowledge on your next project, make each thing better than the last one.
